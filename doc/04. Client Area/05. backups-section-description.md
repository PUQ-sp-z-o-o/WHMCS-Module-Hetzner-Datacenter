The "Backups" section is where you can manage and restore backups of your virtual machine. This section is crucial for maintaining data integrity and providing recovery options in case of system failure or other critical issues.

### Key Features and Actions:

1. **Backup Creation:**
    - **Backup Notes:** There is a text box labeled "Backups notes" where you can enter a description or notes for the backup you are about to create. This allows you to easily identify the purpose or specific details of the backup later on.
    - **Backup Now:** The green **Backup now** button allows you to initiate a new backup of the current state of your virtual machine. This backup will include all data and settings at the time of creation.

2. **Backup Management:**
    - The section lists all existing backups, providing the following details for each: 
        - **Timestamp:** The date and time when the backup was created (e.g., 2024-09-01T18:14:41+00:00).
        - **Backup Name:** The user-defined name or automatically generated name for the backup (e.g., "Backup 2024-09-01T18:14:41.639092+00:00" or "My Backup").

3. **Actions for Each Backup:**
    - **Restore:** The yellow **Restore** button allows you to restore the virtual machine to the state it was in when the backup was created. This will overwrite the current state of the machine with the backup, reverting any changes made since the backup was created.
    - **Remove:** The red **Remove** button allows you to delete the backup. Deleting a backup will free up storage space, but this action is irreversible, so it should be done carefully.

4. **Refresh Button:**
    - **Refresh:** A green **Refresh** button at the top of the section allows you to update the list of backups, ensuring that the most current backups and any recent changes are displayed.
